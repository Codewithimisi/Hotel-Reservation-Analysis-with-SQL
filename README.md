# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-with-SQL

## Project Overview
The hotel industry is heavily reliant on data to make informed decisions that enhance guest satisfaction and optimize operational efficiency. The primary goal of this project is to analyze a hotel reservation dataset using SQL to gain valuable insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other key factors that impact hotel operations. Through this analysis, we aim to enhance decision-making processes and improve guest experiences in the hotel industry.
